        <h1>ASHE</h1>
        <h3>Role: Damage</h3>
        <h5>Ashe quickly fires her rifle from the hip or uses her weaponâ€™s aim-down sights to line up a high damage shot at the cost of fire-rate. She blasts enemies by throwing dynamite, and her coach gun packs enough punch to put some distance between her and her foes, or gain some air to leap to hard to reach places or for an aerial shot. And Ashe is not alone, as she can call on her omnic ally B.O.B. to join the fray when the need arises.</h5>
        <h5><em>"I'm the last one you'll ever cross."</em></h5>
